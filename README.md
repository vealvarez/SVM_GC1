# PredictBiomarker 

Identification of a specific biomarker for <i>A. baumannii</i> GC1 strains using Support Vector Machine.

## Author
Verónica E. Álvarez 

## Synopsis
PredictBiomarker finds short nucleotide sequences in bacterial genomes that can potentially be used as biomarkers. PredictBiomarker was used in the manuscript "Machine learning applied to the molecular identification of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii </i> Global Clone 1" (Álvarez et. al, 2022) to identify a fragment of the <i>moaCB</i> gene as a specific biomarker for <i>A. baumannii</i> GC1 strains.
